### 📌 Project Overview

I designed a KPI framework across 3 core business dimensions focusing on  360° approach **(Inventory, Operations, Customer)**


### ⚡ Executive Summary




---

### 🚩 Business Problem

> Due to Policy & system changes
> The business is experiencing system-wide customer churn driven by high operational friction (late return policies) and inefficient inventory allocation.
> Bad Inventory ➝ Leads to Poor Experience ➝ Causes Late Fees ➝ Creates Friction ➝ Drives Customer Churn


KPI → Business Problem Mapping

| Business Problem                  | Supporting KPIs                                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Inventory Inefficiency           | Inventory Turnover, Asset ROI, Revenue per Title     |
| Operational Friction (Late Fees) | Late Return Rate, Avg Rental Delay                   |
| Customer Churn                   | Recency, Frequency, Monetary, Churn Rate             |


**1. Inventory Problem (Supply Side)**
- Too many low-performing DVDs
- Capital is stuck → can’t invest in better/new content

👉 Result: Low asset efficiency

**2. Operational Problem (Process Issue)**
- ~55% late return rate
- Rental policy (short duration) is unrealistic

👉 Result: Customers are constantly penalized

**3. Customer Problem (Demand Side)**
- Customers stop renting
- Likely due to repeated bad experiences (late fees)

👉 Result: Revenue loss + declining loyalty



> These KPIs collectively reveal a failure loop where inefficient inventory leads to poor customer experience, high late return rates, and ultimately the churn of customers.

### 📊 Key Metrics & KPI Framework ⭐

To evaluate the health of the DVD rental business, the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were defined across Inventory, Operations, and Customer behavior.

| Category   | KPI                     | Definition                                      | Business Purpose                                  | Problem Signal                          |
|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Inventory  | Inventory Turnover       | Total Rentals per Film / Total Copies           | Measures how efficiently inventory is utilized    | Low turnover → Dead stock                |
| Inventory  | Asset ROI                | Total Revenue per Film / Replacement Cost       | Evaluates profitability of each title             | ROI < 1 → Loss-making inventory          |
| Inventory  | Revenue per Title        | Total revenue generated per film                | Identifies high vs low performers                 | Low revenue → Poor demand                |
| Operations | Late Return Rate (LRR)   | Late Returns / Total Rentals                    | Measures customer friction due to policies        | High (>40%) → Policy failure             |
| Operations | Avg Rental Delay         | Avg(Return Date - Allowed Date)                 | Measures severity of delays                       | High delay → Unrealistic duration        |
| Operations | Revenue per Rental       | Avg payment per rental                          | Tracks pricing effectiveness                      | Low → Pricing inefficiency               |
| Customer   | Recency                  | Days since last rental                          | Measures customer activity                        | High → Churn risk                        |
| Customer   | Frequency                | Total rentals per customer                      | Measures engagement level                         | Low → Weak retention                     |
| Customer   | Monetary (CLV Proxy)     | Total spend per customer                        | Identifies high-value customers                   | High value + inactive → Revenue risk     |
| Customer   | Churn Rate               | % of inactive customers (>30 days)              | Tracks customer loss                              | High churn → Growth problem              |

Fix Rental Policy (Top Priority)
> Reduce late return friction
> Adjust rental duration
Optimize Inventory
> Remove dead stock
