### 🚩 Business Problem

The business is experiencing **system-wide customer churn** 

| Category   | Problem     |     Question                                                                 |
|------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inventory  | Supply      |    Is inventory aligned with customer demand?                                  |
| Operations | Process     |    Are rental policies (duration, returns) negatively impacting customers?     |

## ⚙️ SQL Deep-Dive Analysis
 
``` sql


-------------------------------------------------------- 1. Operational


-- 1. Late Return Rate (LRR)
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_returns,
    SUM(
        CASE 
            WHEN r.return_date > DATE_ADD(r.rental_date, INTERVAL f.rental_duration DAY)
            THEN 1 ELSE 0 
        END
    ) AS late_returns,
    ROUND(
        SUM(
            CASE 
                WHEN r.return_date > DATE_ADD(r.rental_date, INTERVAL f.rental_duration DAY)
                THEN 1 ELSE 0 
            END
        ) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2
    ) AS late_return_rate_pct
FROM rental r
JOIN inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
JOIN film f ON i.film_id = f.film_id
WHERE r.return_date IS NOT NULL;



-------------------------------------------------------- 2. Inventory

-- 2. Demand per Copy
SELECT 
    f.title,
    COUNT(r.rental_id) AS total_rentals,
    COUNT(DISTINCT i.inventory_id) AS copies,
    ROUND(COUNT(r.rental_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT i.inventory_id), 2) AS demand_per_copy
FROM film f
JOIN inventory i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
LEFT JOIN rental r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
GROUP BY f.title
ORDER BY demand_per_copy DESC;


-- 3. Asset ROI
SELECT 
    f.title,
    f.replacement_cost,
    SUM(p.amount) AS total_revenue,
    ROUND(SUM(p.amount) / f.replacement_cost, 2) AS asset_roi
FROM film f
JOIN inventory i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
LEFT JOIN rental r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
LEFT JOIN payment p ON r.rental_id = p.rental_id
GROUP BY f.title, f.replacement_cost
ORDER BY asset_roi DESC;
    


-------------------------------------------------------- 👥 3. Customer 

-- 4. Recency

SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    SUM(p.amount) AS total_spent,
    DATEDIFF(
        (SELECT MAX(payment_date) FROM payment),
        MAX(p.payment_date)
    ) AS recency_days
FROM customer c
JOIN payment p 
    ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY recency_days DESC;


```

## 📊 Additional Insights

```sql

-------------------------------------------------------- 4. Time trend analysis

-- Month-over-month growth %
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(payment_date, '%Y-%m') AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS rentals,
    SUM(amount) AS revenue
FROM payment
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;

```

## ✨ Power BI Implementation


``` Powerbi

[Inventory Issues] → [Poor Experience] → [Late Returns] → [Penalties] → [Churn]

> DAX Measures:

----------------------------------------------------Avg Rental Duration

Average Rental Duration: AVG_Duration = AVERAGE(Rental[Duration])


-----------------------------------------------------Customer Segmentation

Customer Tiering: 

Loyalty_Tier = SWITCH(TRUE(),
[Rental_Count] >= 40, "Elite VIP",
[Rental_Count] >= 20, "Preferred",
"Occasional")

-----------------------------------------------------Store Revenue Gap

Store Revenue Gap: Revenue_Gap = [Store 2 Revenue] - [Store 1 Revenue]


```

## 📊 Key Insights

- 💰 Total Revenue: $67,416  
- 👥 Customers: 599  
- 📦 Inventory: 4,581 units  
- 🎬 Films: ~1,000 titles  
- ⏱ Avg Rental Duration: ~5 days  

---

## 🚨 Critical Finding

- 55% Late Return Rate
- 73% Churn Rate
- late returns affected nearly all active customers.

*👉 The system is designed such that the average customer fails.*

## 🔄 Root Cause Loop
Inventory → Experience → Late Returns → Penalties → Churn

## ⚖️ Trade-off

Penalty Revenue ↓  
*👉 Retention is long-term growth*

## 💡 Business Recommendations

### 1. Fix Rental Policy (Top Priority)
- **Increasing rental duration by 1–2 days** could reduce late return rates (~55%) and improve customer satisfaction.
- **Reducing penalty** friction will improve customer experience and retention.

---

### 2. Optimize Inventory
- Identify and **remove low-ROI titles** (Asset ROI < 1).
- **Reallocate invest** toward high-demand, high-turnover films.

---

### 3. Recovery Risk customers
- **Target** inactive customers (>30 days) with re-engagement **campaigns.**
- **Prioritize experience** improvements over discounts or pricing changes.

--- 


## 📈 Business Impact

Reducing the Late Return Rate from ~55% to ~30% will:

- Recover ~15–20% of churned customers
- Reactivate ~80–90 high-value users
- Generate an estimated $8K–$10K in recovered revenue

*👉 This demonstrates that fixing operational friction has a direct and measurable financial impact*




---

### Limitations
- Churn definition assumption (RFM-based)
- No pricing elasticity modeling
- No external market benchmark
- Static simulation dataset (Sakila)
