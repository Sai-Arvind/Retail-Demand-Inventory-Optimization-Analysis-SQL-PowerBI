## ⚡ Executive Summary
- 55% rentals returned late
- 73% customer churn across all segments
- **Root cause:** rental policy mismatch
- Fixing friction can recover ~$8K–$10K revenue

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is simulation of DVD rental business **(Netflix 2006-era & Walmart retail)**.

Analytics lifecycle:
**Descriptive, Diagnostic** and Early stage of **Predictive** Indicators are covered.

### 🚩 Business Problem

The business is experiencing **system-wide customer churn** 

| Category   | Problem     |     Question                                                                 |
|------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Inventory  | Supply      |    Is inventory aligned with customer demand?                                  |
| Operations | Process     |    Are rental policies (duration, returns) negatively impacting customers?     |
| Customer   | Demand      |    Is churn driven by low demand or poor customer experience?                  |

## 🎯 Objective

Build a scalable analytics framework to:

- Audit business performance
- Diagnose root causes of operational inefficiency
- Identify customer churn patterns
- Provide data-driven business recommendations

## 📊 Key Metrics & KPI Framework ⭐

To evaluate the health of the DVD rental business, the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were defined across Inventory, Operations, and Customer behavior.

| Category   | KPI                     | Definition                                      | Business Purpose                                  | Problem Signal                          |
|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Inventory  | Inventory Turnover       | Total Rentals per Film / Total Copies           | Measures how efficiently inventory is utilized    | Low turnover → Dead stock                |
| Inventory  | Asset ROI                | Total Revenue per Film / Replacement Cost       | Evaluates profitability of each title             | ROI < 1 → Loss-making inventory          |
| Inventory  | Revenue per Title        | Total revenue generated per film                | Identifies high vs low performers                 | Low revenue → Poor demand                |
| Operations | Late Return Rate (LRR)   | Late Returns / Total Rentals                    | Measures customer friction due to policies        | High (>40%) → Policy failure             |
| Operations | Avg Rental Delay         | Avg(Return Date - Allowed Date)                 | Measures severity of delays                       | High delay → Unrealistic duration        |
| Operations | Revenue per Rental       | Avg payment per rental                          | Tracks pricing effectiveness                      | Low → Pricing inefficiency               |
| Customer   | Recency                  | Days since last rental                          | Measures customer activity                        | High → Churn risk                        |
| Customer   | Frequency                | Total rentals per customer                      | Measures engagement level                         | Low → Weak retention                     |
| Customer   | Monetary (CLV Proxy)     | Total spend per customer                        | Identifies high-value customers                   | High value + inactive → Revenue risk     |
| Customer   | Churn Rate               | % of inactive customers (>30 days)              | Tracks customer loss                              | High churn → Growth problem              |

## ✨ Power BI Implementation


``` Powerbi

[Inventory Issues] → [Poor Experience] → [Late Returns] → [Penalties] → [Churn]

> DAX Measures:

----------------------------------------------------Avg Rental Duration

Average Rental Duration: AVG_Duration = AVERAGE(Rental[Duration])


-----------------------------------------------------Customer Segmentation

Customer Tiering: 

Loyalty_Tier = SWITCH(TRUE(),
[Rental_Count] >= 40, "Elite VIP",
[Rental_Count] >= 20, "Preferred",
"Occasional")

-----------------------------------------------------Store Revenue Gap

Store Revenue Gap: Revenue_Gap = [Store 2 Revenue] - [Store 1 Revenue]

## 📊 Key Insights

- 💰 Total Revenue: $67,416  
- 👥 Customers: 599  
- 📦 Inventory: 4,581 units  
- 🎬 Films: ~1,000 titles  
- ⏱ Avg Rental Duration: ~5 days  

---

## 🚨 Critical Finding

- 55% Late Return Rate
- 73% Churn Rate
- 100% customers experienced late returns

*👉 The system is designed such that the average customer fails.*


## 🔄 Root Cause Loop
Inventory → Experience → Late Returns → Penalties → Churn

## ⚖️ Trade-off

Penalty Revenue ↓ vs Retention Revenue ↑  
*👉 Retention is long-term growth*


--- 

## 📈 Business Impact

Reducing the Late Return Rate from ~55% to ~30% will:

- Recover ~15–20% of churned customers
- Reactivate ~80–90 high-value users
- Generate an estimated $8K–$10K in recovered revenue

*👉 This demonstrates that fixing operational friction has a direct and measurable financial impact*

## 💡 Business Recommendations

### 1. Fix Rental Policy (Top Priority)
- Increasing rental duration by 1–2 days could reduce late return rates (~55%) and improve customer satisfaction.
- Reducing penalty friction will improve customer experience and retention.

---

### 2. Optimize Inventory
- Identify and remove low-ROI titles (Asset ROI < 1).
- Reallocate invest toward high-demand, high-turnover films.

---

### 3. Recovery Risk customers
- Target inactive customers (>30 days) with re-engagement campaigns.
- Prioritize experience improvements over discounts or pricing changes.

--- 

## 📉 If No Changes made in system

- High-value customers will churn first  
- Penalty-driven revenue will decline  
- Inventory ROI will continue to drop
